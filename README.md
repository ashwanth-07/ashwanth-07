## Featured Projects

1. **Brain Tumor Segmentation (Mar. 2024)**: Trained 2D and 3D UNet based models to compare performance on multi-class brain tumor segmentation. Implemented 2D and 3D versions of UNet, ResUNet, and Attention ResUNet architectures using PyTorch. Created a novel Mixture of Experts architecture for 2D Attention ResUNet and improved IOU score by 6%.
2. **Library Management System (Jan. 2022 - Apr. 2022)**: Led a team to develop a comprehensive system for managing library operations, utilizing React.js, Node.js, and Firebase.
3. **Intelligent Crop Recommendation System (Jul. 2021 - Nov. 2021)**: Implemented various machine learning models for soil dataset analysis, achieving 95% accuracy with the Na√Øve Bayes classifier.
